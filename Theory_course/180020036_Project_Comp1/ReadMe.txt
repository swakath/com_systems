* Letter_Error_Graph and Word_Error_Graph .jpg files are letter error rate vs snr graph and word error rate vs snr graph respectively

* Please note in case if you are running Main_Word_Error.m, the program takes 50 words to plot the graph, hence it takes long time to execute. To compute faster reduce the number of words.
